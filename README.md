### Project Summary

**Title: Stock Performance and Cost of Equity Analysis**

This project involves analyzing the performance of a given stock relative to the S&P 500 index (^GSPC) over a specified period. The analysis includes calculating the stock's Beta, the R-squared value from a regression model, and the Cost of Equity using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The project also includes visualizing the stock's adjusted close prices compared to the S&P 500 index and normalizing the prices for comparative analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Stock Performance Analysis:** Downloaded historical stock and S&P 500 data and calculated daily percentage changes.
- **Regression Analysis:** Performed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to determine the stock's Beta and R-squared value.
- **Cost of Equity Calculation:** Calculated the Cost of Equity using the CAPM formula, incorporating the US 10-year Treasury bond rate as the risk-free rate.
- **Data Visualization:** Created comparative plots of adjusted close prices and normalized prices between the stock and the S&P 500 index.

### Key Skills:
- **Programming:** Python (yfinance, statsmodels, Matplotlib)
- **Data Analysis:** Regression analysis, Beta calculation, Cost of Equity (CAPM)
- **Financial Analysis:** Stock performance metrics, risk-free rate integration
- **Data Visualization:** Comparative and normalized price plotting
